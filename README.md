# Semeval-2012-task-4-evaluating-chinese-word-similarity
This task focuses on evaluating word similarity computation in Chinese. We follow the way of Finkelstein et al.(2002) to select word pairs. We organize twenty undergraduates who are major in Chinese linguistics to annotate the data. Each pair is assigned a similarity score by each annotator. We rank the word pairs by the average value of similar scores among the twenty annotators. This data is used as gold standard. Four systems participate in this task. We evaluate their results on gold standard data in term of Kendall's tau value, and the results show three of them have a positive correlation with the rank manually created while the taus' value is very small.
